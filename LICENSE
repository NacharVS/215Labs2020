                     Server Side Public License
                     VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

                    Copyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
  
  “This License” refers to Server Side Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
  “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

  To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
  a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
  earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

  A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
  the Program.

  To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
  computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the
  extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
  (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
  there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
  are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
  how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
  user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
  meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a
  work.

  A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
  widely used among developers working in that language.  The “System
  Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as
  a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
  Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves
  only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement
  a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the
  public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a
  major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
  specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or
  a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
  to run it.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the
  source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
  the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
  those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
  Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
  which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
  not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes
  interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and
  the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
  that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
  data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
  parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
  regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The
  output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the
  output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
  acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
  copyright law.  Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate
  covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
  license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to
  others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively
  for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
  that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
  material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
  running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
  behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them
  from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
  relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
  conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
  unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
  of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
  prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
  effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
  covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,
  your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
  intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
  added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
  of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
  License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for
  each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
  protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
  of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
    and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all
    notices”.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
    whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
    packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any
    other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
    separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
    need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
  which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on
  a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if
  the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
  access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
  individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
  not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
  
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
  sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
  Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
  ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
    used for software interchange.
   
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
    offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
    offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
    covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
    for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost
    of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to
    copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
   
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
    the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
   
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy
    the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on
    a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
    equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
    next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
    Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
    obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
    satisfy these requirements.
   
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
    subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
  in conveying the object code work.

  A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
  product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

  “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
  of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
  Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
  (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
  Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the
  Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
  you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
  code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in
  ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
  to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially
  and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the
  rules and protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
  accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
  (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
  and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
  copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
  treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
  they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
  to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
  permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
  without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of
  a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions
  from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be
  written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the
  work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to
  a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
  permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
  to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
    names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
    licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
  restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
  you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
  restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
  may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
  document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
  relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
  place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
  that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
  applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
  stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as
  exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
  it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
  License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
  of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
  your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
  notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
  after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
  permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
  reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
  violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
  you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
  copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
  solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
  copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
  this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
  work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
  a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
  work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
  compliance by third parties with this License.

  An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
  results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
  receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
  the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
  paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
  work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
  get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
  granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
  license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted
  under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
  is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
  the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
  thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

  A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or
  controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
  acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
  License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
  include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
  modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
  “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
  use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
  the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party
  means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
  against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
  the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
  free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
  available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
  either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
  arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
  particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
  requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
  recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
  for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
  your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
  one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
  to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving
  the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
  specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
  automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
  based on it.

  A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
  scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
  the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
  granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
  a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
  distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
  based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
  which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
  covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
  with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
  those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
  products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
  entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior
  to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
  implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
  available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use,
  propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
  obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
  as a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For
  example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
  further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
  you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
  entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Offering the Program as a Service.

  If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version
  available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source
  Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the
  terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or
  modified version available to third parties as a service includes,
  without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the
  functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a
  computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or
  primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or
  offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the
  Program or modified version.

  “Service Source Code” means the Corresponding Source for the Program or
  the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that
  you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service,
  including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,
  application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,
  backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a
  user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code
  you make available.  

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side
  Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
  problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public
  License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
  any later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not
  specify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may
  choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
  the Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
  of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
  version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
  holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
  ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
  THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
  LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
  OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
  cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
  courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
  waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
  warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
  return for a fee.
  
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
